# About this Repository ðŸ“‹

This repo contains 2 distinct SQL projects which were part of the [Think SQL: Zero to Hero](https://www.namastesql.com/course-detail/think-sql-go-from-zero-to-hero-english) course.

I have used `MySQL` for data wrangling and analysis.

What I appreciated the most were the hands-on exercises and real-world examples, which helped reinforce my understanding and allowed me to practice what I learned.
